#The purpose of robot "KAT" is to navigate a labyrinth made up of perpendicular "paths,"
#find the exit, construct a map of the labyrinth featuring a path to the exit, and sending
#the map to another Dexter Industries GoPiGo.
#The algorithm of traversing the labyrinth workd as follows:
#1. Each intersection has four options: turn right, go straight, turn left, or turn around.
#1.1 T-Junctions are intersections where either right, straight, or left isn't available.
#1.2 Dead-ends are intersections where only turn around is available.
#2. Decision priority at intersections is as follows:
#2.1 If at intersection, turn right.
#2.2 Else if right turn isn't available, go straight.
#2.3 Else if straight isn't available, turn left.
#2.4 Else (i.e., if left turn isn't available), turn around.
#3. Whenever an intersection is reached, make a turn, and add it to the map.
#4. If dead-end is reached, turn around, take the next available turn at the previous
#   intersection and mark it correspondingly on the map.
#Exit is identified by the user pressing the space bar.
