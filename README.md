# GUIGoPiGo

GUIGoPiGo is a system that allows a user to navigate the Raspberry Pi powered GoPiGo robot, along a given maze. The maze is a whiteboard, with black electrical tape representing edges. When given nodes, represented by the blue buttons, the robot will calculate the shortest path using the A* pathfinding algorithm. The progress of the robot along the path is represented by blue lines, and a image of the robot moving to each respective node.

Additionally, the user can choose put an obstacle on an edge by clicking on any edge on the map, which will highlight red. The robot will take this into account during it's calculation, and attempt to find a different path. If there is no valid path to traverse, the robot will not move. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run the software, you'll need:
-A GoPiGO3 robot kit
-Raspberry Pi (equpped with wifi dongle or onboard Wi-Fi)
-Python 3.4+ installed on the robot
-Pip
-tornado and GoPiGo modules
-A computer
-Any modern web browser (NOTE: The webpage has only been tested with Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge, and Chromium. Any other browsers, such as the browser that is included with the Raspberry Pi are NOT guaranteed to display the webpage properly/support websockets.)

### Installing

1. Click the "Clone or Download" button on GitHub to clone a copy of the repository. Download it as a zip file, and extract the contents to a USB stick.
2. Transfer the files into the desired directory on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Open the terminal, and ensure that you have the correct Python version (3.4+), and the modules tornado and GoPiGO installed. If not, use the pip installer, and enter these commands:
```
pip install tornado
```
```
pip install GoPiGo
```
## Running the Robot
1. Open the file titled "MasterControlProgram.py". This will bring up the
2. Open the file called "wepage.html". It is located in the path ```GUIGoPiGo/GUI/src/webpage.html``` .
3. Enter the IP address of your robot. You can also enter "localhost" if your robot is not connected to the internet.
4. Select the desired waypoints and/or blocked edges.
5. Place the rover on n1, facing the n2 node.
6. Click start.
7. Watch the robot go!! 

### Tips for Good Performance

-Ensure the room that you plan to test in has adequete lighting. The line sensor is extremely sensitive, and lack of adequete lighting will cause the robot to deviate from it's path.
-Make sure that the surface is clean and white, and the lines are black. The robot works by detecting raw values from the surface and converting them into absolute values (1 for black, and 0 for white). Smudges and dirt will negatively impact performance.
